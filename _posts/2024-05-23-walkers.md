[this is my first experiment](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/walker-expo1/index.html)
<p>for this first experiement I wanted to experiement more with sound and random walkers. using the starter code I used triangles to create a butterfly effect of lines which builds up over time. noise(pos.x * 0.5, pos.y * 0.03, frameCount * 0.03) * TWO_PI: this part of the code this line works out a value for the noise based on the triangles position and the framecount. the 0.5 and 0.03 were a sweet spot for the position change as anymore would have been to random and distort the butterfly effect it gives. </p>


[This is my second experiment](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/walker-expo2/index.html)
<img src="walker expo 3 ss.png">
<p> this is used with the starter code from class for the first random walker.for this experiment I used the WEBGL parameter again which made a really interesting visual experience with the ellipsoids still having the grid outline which all 3d shapes start with adds a quirky dimension to the visual. by also tweaking the noise and framecount is what gave it that fast paced glitchy look. function edges(){
  if(xPos<0){ 
    xPos=width-5
    xPrev=xPos: this function is what stops the glitching ellipse from escaping the edges of the canvas, it checks if the position is less than 0 meaning its off the edge then it sets the new position to -5 which is 5 pixels from the edge. then updates the previous position with the new one which is how it has a kind of pulsating effect.</p>

[This is my third experiment](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/walker-expo3/index.html)

<p>by drawing an ellipse and having pos.x/2, pos.y/2 there it halves the size of the ellipse depending on its position. changing the background opacity and color it makes a clouding effect which could be useful for something like a 2D game or visual experience. when left over time it creates a cool triangular trail of circles which are fading.</p>

[This is my final experiment](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/walker-expofinal/index.html)
<img src="walker final ss.png>
<p>for my final experiment I was playing around with making a trail effect for the walkers. the for loop iterates 15 times to draw the trail segments. 
 line(trailPos.x, trailPos.y, prev.x, prev.y); this part of code draws lines between the calculated trail positions. this created a snake like effect with trailing colors which when I added the WEBGL parameter and drew an ellipsoid with the first two parameters being the trail position for the x and y axis. this surprised me at how much different just two changes made from a really simple trail to a choppy grid with some really smooth movements. this technique is something that I have explored across alot of different techniques as I feel it can make for a really effective visual experience.</p>
