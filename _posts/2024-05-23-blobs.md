<p>The starter code I used for this technique was the clickables blobs done in lesson. for this I wanted to make some sort of pleasing visual which then turned into a game like style of code the more I played around with it.</p>

<p>for this first experiment I made some minor changes to the figures and implemented the WEBGL parameter and changed the blobs to ellipsoids which surprisingly gave the effect of many lines crossing eachother when the mouse is pressed then these lines would shift creating a cool glitchy feel which I feel would pair well with something like an immersive experience.</p>

[this is my first experiment](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/blob-expo1/index.html)
<p>for my second experiment I wanted to include some sort of instructions for the user to follow by implementing text. I found that when the scroll wheel is used instead of pressing the mouse made for a more satisfying user experience to move the blobs and reveal the hidden message</p>
