After experimenting with what can be done with 3D shapes and demonstrating a few of them in my first experiment, I wanted to explore the movement of 3D shapes paired with noise to create a pleasing graphic. 

With this experiment I found a 3D tutorial online to make a spiral flower: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddu6W0bBI5g 
using this I then took the for loop used in the tutorial then adjusted some of the figures. 

for(let a=-15;a<TWO_PI;a+=1): this loop iterates variable a from -15 to 2pi in increments of 1. this allows the following part of code to create multiple copies and changes the start position to create the circular shape.

translate(a+50,0); : this line translates the coordinate by a+50 on the x-axis which places each box horizontally with a spacing of 2.

angle+=0.0003:
