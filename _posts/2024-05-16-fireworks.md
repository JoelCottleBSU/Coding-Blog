[This is the original firework project](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/fireworks/index.html)

<p>The starter code I am using for this is the fireworks done in class. For my first experiment I was messing around with the color so that each particle has a random color. Then I experimented using the WEBGL parameter and seeing what happens if I swap the particles from being an ellipse to an ellipsoid this created a really nice glitch effect when the mouse is pressed.  show(){
fill(this.col,200,250)
noStroke()
ellipsoid(this.x, this.y, 0.05) :this code fill the ellipsoids with a random color and then draws it from the center of the canvas and I found that having the ellipsoid really small is what gave the best effect.</p>

[This is my first experiement](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/fireworks-expo2/index.html)
<p> in my second experiment I wanted to keep the original firework effect but create a wave shape. by slightly altering the code so that the particles only stay on the move on the x-axis, changing the color and shape from an ellipsoid to a square it falls in the style of a wave.</p>

<p>carrying on from my last experiment I wanted to try out the effcts different shapes have. for this one I used the quad shape and changed when the mouse wheel was scrolled it creates a really nice outward sweeping effect for each shape. I also multiplied the movement of the x-axis by 2 so that it sweeps across the page sideways. could be used for a transition in a video?</p>

[This is my third experiment](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/fireworks-expo4/index.html)

<p>for my final experiment I removed the fall and gravity of the particles and lowered the speed. by lowering the speed to 0.6 I found that when left for a while it gives the effect of travelling through space with only some simple changes. This would be great for a 3D game if a character is wanting to be seen travlling quickly.</p>
