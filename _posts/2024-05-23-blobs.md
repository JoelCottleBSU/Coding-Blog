<p>The starter code I used for this technique was the clickables blobs done in lesson. for this I wanted to make some sort of pleasing visual which then turned into a game like style of code the more I played around with it.</p>

<p>for this first experiment I made some minor changes to the figures and implemented the WEBGL parameter and changed the blobs to ellipsoids which surprisingly gave the effect of many lines crossing eachother when the mouse is pressed then these lines would shift creating a cool glitchy feel which I feel would pair well with something like an immersive experience. the lines would then shift when clicked in a random spot creating some really nice layering.in order to get the smooth transition instead of jumpy movements this.x += (this.tx - this.x) / 10 and this.y += (this.ty - this.y) / 10: updates the x and y position of the blob and moves towards target position then divides by 10 which is what slows it down.

[this is my first experiment](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/blob-expo1/index.html)
<p>for my second experiment I wanted to include some sort of instructions for the user to follow by implementing text. I found that when the scroll wheel is used instead of pressing the mouse made for a more satisfying user experience to move the blobs and reveal the hidden message.  to allow the blobs to move when the wheel is scrolled the code: function mouseWheel(){
  cbs.forEach(function(cb){
    cb.click()
  })
} is used. which when the mouse wheel is scrolled it triggers the click fucntion on each blob.</p>

<p>for this experiment I wanted to mess around with the movement more so by making the blobs float around and react by shooting in the opposite direction when pressed by making the velocity variable negative gave me some ideas for furthering this and to make it into a fun user experience. to change the velocity the code  click(){
    if(this.hover){
      this.vx=random(-10, 10)//changes direction suddenly on click
      this.vy=random(-10, 10)
    }
  } which means if the mouse is hovering and clicked on a blob it sets the x and y velocity to a rasndom figure between -10 and 10.</p>

[this is my third experiment](/Coding-Blog/codeExperiments/blob-expo3/index.html)

<p>for my final experiement I implemented random colors and sizes for each blob to give it a more playful look, then having random initial velocities for both x and y axis. 

if (this.x < 0 || this.x > width) { this.vx *= -1; : this part of the code reverses the direction of the blob once it hits the barrier (width) by making its velocity negative.</p>
